This repo contains 50 meta-prompts to help generate high-quality prompt engineering examples for LLM training and evaluation.

Use these prompts to:

- Create zero-shot, few-shot, or chain-of-thought prompts
- Generate diverse and complex prompt formats
- Simulate tasks like translation, summarization, reasoning
- Train or benchmark LLMs on prompt design capabilities

See `prompt_engineering_prompts_sample.csv` for full details.
